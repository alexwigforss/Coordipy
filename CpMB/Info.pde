/******************************************************
circleBoxCollide
 
Demostrates collision of a moving circle and static
rectangle. The problem first is to figure out how
whether the two shapes touch, and then what to do as
a consequence. For this sketch I just cover detection of
collision between two shapes.
 
For whether two shapes touch, see the function
isCollidingCircleRectangle at the bottom of this sketch,
it covers the case of circle and rectangle intersection.
Rectangle to rectangle should be slightly easier, and
circle to circle intersection is even easier.
 
See http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collision_detection for more
info, or check out the processing simulation libraries at
http://processing.org/reference/libraries/#simulation_math or
http://jbox2d.nfshost.com/processing/ . Be warned that the
links above make heavy use of code not covered in class.
